# Playlist Editor

Playlists are an essential part of sdrtrunk.  All of the decoding, channel selection, streaming, aliasing of talkgroups and radio identifiers, etc is controlled by playlists.  The playlist editor gives you access to each of these pieces and includes fully integrated access to the world-wide database of radio network information at radioreference.com (when you have paid premium subscription).

The playlist editor is made up of the following components:
* **Playlists** - manage all of your playlists and select the current playlist
* **Channels** - create channel and decoder configurations and start/stop decoding
* **Aliases** - create aliases and names for a variety of identifiers like talkgroups and radio IDs
* **Streaming** - manage audio streaming and assign aliases to streaming channels
* **Radio Reference** - online radio system database for easy downloading radio systems and talkgroups

## Playlists Tab
The playlist tab allows you to manage your playlists.  Only one playlist can be active (selected) at any time. A default playlist (**default.xml**) is automatically created for you when you use the software for the first time.

The playlist table provides a list of playlist files available to sdrtrunk.  The **Selected** column indicates the currently active/selected playlist with a green checkmark.

### Playlist Buttons
* **Select** - makes the selected playlist the active playlist.  This will unload the current playlist and load the selected playlist.  Any actively decoding channels will be stopped.  All channels, aliases and stream configurations from the current playlist will be removed and the channels, aliases and stream configurations for the selected playlist will be loaded.
* **New** - creates a new empty playlist.
* **Add** - adds a playlist to the editor.  Use this button to add other playlists to the editor that are in different folders than the sdrtrunk playlist folder.
* **Remove** - removes the currently selected playlist from sdrtrunk.  Does NOT delete the file.
* **Clone** - creates a comlete copy of the currently selected playlist.
* **Delete** - removes the currently selected playlist from sdrtrunk AND deletes the file from the file system.
