# Playlist Editor

## Playlist Tab
The playlist tab allows you to manage your playlists.  Only one playlist can be active (selected) at any time. A default playlist (**default.xml**) is automatically created for you when you use the software for the first time.

The playlist table provides a list of playlist files available to sdrtrunk.  The **Selected** column indicates the currently active/selected playlist with a green checkmark.

### Playlist Buttons
* **Select** - makes the selected playlist the active playlist.  This will unload the current playlist and load the selected playlist.  Any actively decoding channels will be stopped.  All channels, aliases and stream configurations from the current playlist will be removed and the channels, aliases and stream configuraitons for the selected playlist will be loaded.

* **New** - creates a new empty playlist.
* **Add** - adds a playlist to the editor.  Use this button to add other playlists to the editor that are in different folders than the sdrtrunk playlist folder.
