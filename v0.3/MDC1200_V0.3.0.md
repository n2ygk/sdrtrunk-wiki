# MDC-1200 Decoder #

The MDC-1200 decoder processes Automatic Number Identification (ANI) data
bursts that are used in some analog radio networks to identify individual radios
each time they broadcast on the repeater or trunked radio channel.

Note: this decoder doesn't currently provide error detection and correction and
therefore it may produce invalid decoded messages.  If you have access to a 
radio with MDC1200 capability and can provide quality audio recordings of the 
various data bursts, please contact the author via the Google support group.

## Decoder Setup - Conventional or Repeater Network ##

Setup a decoding channel with a NBFM decoder and select MDC1200 in the aux
decoder configuration tab.

## Decoder Setup - Analog Trunked Network ##

Setup a decoding channel with one of the analog trunked radio decoders (LTR,
LTRNet, Passport, etc) and select MDC1200 in the aux decoder configuration tab.
