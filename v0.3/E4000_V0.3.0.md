## E4000 Tuner Configuration ##

SDRTrunk uses the serial number label from the E4000 to associate the most recently used tuner configuration.  This serial number can be set/changed using the rtl\_eeprom utility, 

All changes to a named configuration are automatically saved.

### Configuration ###

  * **Name** - tuner configuration name.
  * **Tuner Info** - see next section
  * **Sample Rate** - sets the sample rate to use for the tuner.
  * **PPM** - correction value (parts per million) to align the currently tuned frequency with the frequency display values.  Increasing the value causes the frequency display to move to the left and vice-versa.
  * **Master Gain** - sets the overall gain for the tuner and automatically controls the individual gain controls.  Use the **Manual** setting to enable and independently change the LNA, Mixer and Enhance gain controls
  * **Mixer Gain** - sets the Mixer gain.  Place the Master Gain into **Manual** mode to enable this control.
