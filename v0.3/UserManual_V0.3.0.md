Application Overview
---
SDRTrunk is a software application for monitoring, decoding and internet streaming of
analog and digital radio communications systems.  It is designed to operate with 
multiple external and dongle-type USB tuners.  The application allows you to process
multiple radio channels simultaneously, limited only by your computer's processing 
power and the tunable bandwidth of each of the tuners attached to your computer.  It
also supports automatically creating and tuning to traffic channels in trunked 
radio systems when decoding the system control channel.
