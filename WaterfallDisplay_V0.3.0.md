Right-click anywhere in the waterfall display to view a list of context-sensitive menu options.  See the [Spectral Display](SpectralDisplay) page to see descriptions of the Color, Display and Frequency context menus.

  * **Pause** - pauses the waterfall and displays **Paused** in the upper left corner.  When you un-pause the display, the waterfall will show all frequency history that happened while paused.
  
Note: if you see a signal in the waterfall, you can pause the waterfall and use the zoom control to zoom in on the transmission to inspect the bandwidth and frequency, or other features of the signal.  You can optionally expand the viewable height of the waterfall window to view waterfall signals that appear to have scrolled off the screen.  There is a limited history available.
