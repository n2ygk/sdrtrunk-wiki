## Reporting Bugs/Errors and Feature Requests

### [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/issues)
The Github Issues feature allows users to report bugs and request features to add to the software.  This is not a user
support forum, so **please DO NOT open new issues to post user questions.**  This wastes developer time by 
creating a mess that the developer has to clean up.

### Tips for Reporting Bugs & Errors
1. Search the list of GitHub issues and support forums to see if someone had already reported the error.
2. Post a message on one of the support forums to see if someone else is having the same issue.  The developer will
normally create a new GitHub issue to track the error through to resolution.
3. If you don't get a response, go ahead and create a new issue.  Please provide as many details as possible:
* Version of sdrtrunk
* Operating System & Machine Specs (CPU & Memory)
* sdrtrunk Application Log or relevant error printout from the log
* What were you doing or how were you using the application when the error occurred?
